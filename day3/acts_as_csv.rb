The next step is to take the file and attach that behavior 
to a class with a module method often called a macro. Macros change 
the behavior of classes, often based on changes in the environment.
In this case, our macro opens up the class and dumps in all the 
behavior related to a CSV file:

The metaprogramming happens in the acts_as_csv macro. That code calls 
define_method for all the methods we want to add to the target class. 
Now, when the target class calls acts_as_csv, that code will define all four methods on the target class.
So, the acts_as macro code does nothing but add a few methods we could have 
easily added through inheritance. That design does not seem like much of an improvement, 
but itâ€™s about to get more inter- esting.
